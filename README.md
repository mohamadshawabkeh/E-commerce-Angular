# ECom

This project is an e-commerce application developed with Angular. It was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.4.

## Project Overview

ECom is a dynamic e-commerce website designed to provide an engaging shopping experience. The application utilizes Angular to build a responsive and scalable front-end, leveraging various Angular features and best practices.

## Key Angular Features Used

- **Components**: The application is structured using Angular components, which allow for modular and reusable code.
- **Services**: Angular services are used to handle business logic and data management, including interactions with external APIs.
- **Routing**: Angular Router is employed for navigation between different views and managing user routes within the application.
- **Forms**: Angular Reactive Forms and Template-driven Forms are used for handling user input and validations.
- **Dependency Injection**: Angular's built-in dependency injection is used to manage services and inject dependencies where needed.
- **HTTP Client**: Angularâ€™s HttpClient module is used to communicate with the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for retrieving product data and handling user authentication.
- **Pipes and Directives**: Custom pipes and directives are used to format data and enhance functionality.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the application. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Use the following commands to generate various elements of the application:
- `ng generate component component-name`: Generate a new component.
- `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`: Generate other Angular elements as needed.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The build process optimizes the application for production.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Unit tests ensure that individual units of the application are functioning correctly.

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests. This requires a testing package to be added that implements end-to-end testing capabilities. End-to-end tests verify the application's behavior from the user's perspective.

## API Integration

The application integrates with the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch and manage product data, handle user authentication, and process transactions.

## Design Resources

The user interface design for the application is based on a [free Figma template](https://www.figma.com/design/2o6dtQ46i8fMsAe3jXNKaQ/75%2B-Ecommerce-Landing-Page-Templates-(Community)?node-id=6314-7685). This design provides a modern and responsive layout for the e-commerce platform.
